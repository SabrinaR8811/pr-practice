## Mr. Mueller's Ideal Afternoon

The best way to relax after a long day is to eat ice cream and watch a movie.

The best ice cream is mint chocolate chip.

## Sabrina's Ideal Afternoon

The best way to relax after a long day is by curling up under the covers, with a plate of orange-cranberry scones and a cup of peppermint-green tea, wearing a shark onesie and cuddling with an anime plush, watching cartoons with the lights off and the blinds closed so it's like you're in a movie theatre, the only light sources coming from the TV screen and a lava lamp

The best ice cream is, indeed, mint chocolate chip, but have you considered adding strawberry slices to it? A shockingly good addition!!
